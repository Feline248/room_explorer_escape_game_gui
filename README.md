An escape room game made for my computer science class. The original, text-based version is available here: https://github.com/Feline248/room_explorer_escape_game


To play, open the terminal, command prompt, or equivalent program, navigate to the room_explorer_game folder, and then type either py on a windows system or python3 on mac or linux followed by .\room_explorer_code\main.py

Example:

    cd .\Documents\CSC131\Python\room_explorer_game
    py .\room_explorer_code\main.py

make sure you run the main.py file and not test.py

DO NOT move any files inside the room_explorer_game folder, it will make the program crash when sounds are played

You can type "a", "controls", or "help" in the game for instructions. There is a controls.txt file in the info folder, as well as a map of the house and an audio file of recording bloopers.
